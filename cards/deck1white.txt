Being a dinosaur
Literally eating shit
Clams
Dorito breath
Clenched butt cheeks
My machete
One thousand Slim Jims
The shambling corpse of Larry King
Moral Ambiguity
Quiche
Wearing an octopus for a hat
An unhinged ferris wheel rolling toward the sea
Living in a trashcan
A magic hippie love cloud
Jeff Goldblum
Crabapples all over the fucking sidewalk
A sofa that says "I have style, but I like to be comfortable"
Dining with cardboard cutouts of the cast of "Friends"
A squadron of moles wearing aviator goggles
Bullshit
An army of skeletons
A man in yoga pants with a ponytail and feather earrings
Nunchuck moves
A sweet spaceship
Boris the Soviet Love Hammer
Tiny nipples
A dollop of sour cream
A slightly shittier parallel universe
Basic human decency
Death by Steven Seagal
