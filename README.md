## CAH_SystemVerilogSimulation

This is a System Verilog random sequence exercise using cards from [Cards Against
Humanity](https://cardsagainsthumanity.com/)&copy;. The most offensive cards haven't been included,
but this project is still not entirely kid-friendly. 

The included Makefile can be used to compile and run the simulation that will generate random card
sequences from the included text files. The Makefile commands assume Mentor Graphics QuestaSim&reg;
is installed on the host system.
